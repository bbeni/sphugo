/* K-nearest-neighbor search Example

Author: Benjamin Frölich

Goal:
	Implement the k nearest neighbor search. Use the priority queue given in the
	Python template and implement “replace” and “key” functions.
	Use the particle to cell distance function from the lecture notes
	or the celldist2() given in the Python template. Are they the same?

	Optional: Also implement the ball search algorithm given in the lecture notes.
